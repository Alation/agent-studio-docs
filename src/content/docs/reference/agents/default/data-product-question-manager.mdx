title: Data Product Question Manager
description: An agent for managing SQL evaluation questions - creating new questions and auditing existing ones
---

The Data Product Question Manager agent helps you build and maintain high-quality SQL evaluation sets for your data products.
It can generate new question/SQL pairs and audit existing ones for quality and correctness.

## How it works

The agent follows this workflow:

1. Reviews existing evaluation questions to avoid duplicates and understand terminology
2. Explores data schemas and sample values to understand business context
3. Generates diverse questions across five complexity categories (complex filters, joins, column transformations, business jargon, complex operators)
4. Validates each SQL query by executing it against the data product
5. Saves the evaluation set as a CSV and presents it for review
6. Uploads the evaluation set after receiving user confirmation
7. For auditing tasks, reviews existing questions for SQL correctness, clarity, coverage, and duplicates

## Input parameters

### Required

- **message** (string): The request to send to the agent (e.g., "Generate 10 new evaluation questions" or "Audit existing questions")
- **data_product_id** (string): The ID of the data product to manage evaluation questions for

## Output format

- **message** (string): The final response with evaluation set details and upload confirmation

## Available tools

The agent has access to ten tools organized into three categories:

### Evaluation management

- **Get SQL Evaluation Set**: Retrieve existing question/SQL pairs to avoid duplicates and understand current coverage
- **Get SQL Evaluation Case**: Retrieve details of a specific evaluation case by ID
- **Update SQL Evaluation Case**: Modify the question or SQL of an existing evaluation case
- **Delete SQL Evaluation Case**: Remove an evaluation case from the set
- **Upload SQL Evaluation Set**: Upload a completed evaluation set to the data product

### Data exploration

- **Get Data Schema**: Retrieve schema information to understand available tables and columns
- **SQL Execution**: Execute and validate SQL queries against the data product

### Asset management

- **Save Asset**: Save evaluation sets as CSV files for review and upload
- **Retrieve Asset**: Retrieve previously saved evaluation sets
- **List Assets**: Discover available saved assets

## Behavior notes

- Questions must represent realistic business inquiries, not trivial queries like "how many rows in my data"
- The agent generates no more than 20 questions at a time
- Questions should be concise and sound natural, as if asked by a business user
- All updates and deletions require user confirmation
- Evaluation sets are saved in CSV format with columns: `question`, `sql`, `notes`
