title: Dashboard Search
description: An agent for querying BI reports.
---

The dashboard search agent retrieves relevant dashboards from the catalog.

## How it works

The agent follows this workflow:

1. Receives a natural language question from the user
2. Extracts search terms and identifies filter fields and values to search with
3. Executes the search to obtain dashboards
4. Summarizes the search results and includes relevant dashboards to the user's request in the final answer

## Input parameters

Required:

- `message` (string): The natural language question or request to send to the agent

## Output format

The agent produces a series of thinking, tool call, tool return, and text blocks as it works through the user request.
The final message, assuming no errors, is a json object with these parameters:

- `message` (string): The final answer to the user's request
- `relevant_objects` (array): A list of BIReportObject, each containing:
  - `url` (string): The URL to access the dashboard
  - `title` (string): The name of the dashboard
  - `description` (string): The description of the dashboard
  - `breadcrumbs` (array): The list of folder names leading to the dashboard in the catalog
  - `type` (object): The dashboard type.

## Available tools

The agent is configured with 3 tools:

### BI report search

Searches for dashboards in the catalog relevant to the user's question.

**Key parameters:**
- `search_term`: The main search term extracted from the user's question
- `filters`: Optional filters extracted from the user's question to narrow down the search (e.g., folder names, tags)
- `limit`: The maximum number of dashboards to return

### Search filter fields

Identifies relevant fields which are available in the system to refine the dashboard search.

**Key parameters:**

- `search_term`: The filter field search term extracted from the user's question
- `limit`: The maximum number of filter fields to return

### Search filter fields

Search over values of a specific field to identify relevant values to refine the dashboard search.

**Key parameters:**

- `field_id`: The ID of the field to search values in
- `search_term`: The filter value search term extracted from the user's question
- `limit`: The maximum number of filter values to return

## Behavior notes

- The agent returns a structured object as its final response, including both the final message and relevant objects
