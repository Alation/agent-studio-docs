description: An analytics assistant that decomposes and solves complex research requests
---

The Deep Research agent is an expert analytics assistant designed to tackle complex, multi-faceted questions.
It breaks down complex requests into systematic research plans, executes them step-by-step, and delivers comprehensive, data-driven summaries.

## How it works

The agent follows this workflow:

1. Analyzes and decomposes the user's research request
2. Discovers relevant data products if none are specified
3. Retrieves schemas to understand available data and relationships
4. Creates a structured research plan with business-friendly language (or uses a provided plan)
5. Executes each research step independently, running SQL queries to extract data
6. Documents findings in plain language as it progresses
7. Synthesizes all findings into a comprehensive final summary with actionable insights and specific metrics

## Input parameters

Required:

- `message` (string): The complex question or research request

## Output format

The agent produces a series of thinking, tool call, tool return, and text blocks as it works through the user request.
The final message, assuming no errors, is a json object containing:

- `summary` (string): A comprehensive final summary addressing the original question
- `plan` (object): The research plan used (saveable for future use)
  - `plan_title` (string): The title of the research plan
  - `plan_steps` (array): List of research steps, each containing:
    - `section_header` (string): The main goal for this research step
    - `instructions` (array of strings): The list of analytics questions for the step
  - `plan_goal` (string, optional): The main research goal

## Available tools

The agent has access to three tools:

### List available data products

Discovers relevant data products based on the user's question.
Returns up to 5 data products by default using semantic search.

### Get data schema

Retrieves schema information for data products.
Supports optional semantic search of sample values.

### SQL execution

Executes SQL queries against data products to extract insights and data.

## Behavior notes

- **No clarification questions**: The agent uses best judgment to interpret vague requests and provides complete answers
- **Data-driven focus**: Prioritizes calculations, aggregations, trends, and specific metrics over metadata
- **Business-friendly language**: Avoids SQL, tool names, and technical identifiers in user-facing text
- **Concurrent execution**: Invokes multiple independent tools simultaneously for efficiency
- **Critical thinking**: Carefully analyzes tool results to ensure high-quality, accurate answers
- **Comprehensive results**: Always aims to fully address the request, even if information is incomplete
