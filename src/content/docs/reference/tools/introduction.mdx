Tools are one of the main primitives for building agentic workflows & systems.
Agents can choose to call tools as they see fit in order to learn about their environment, and to take actions to act upon this information. 
Typically, tools will be accessed through an [MCP server](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/key-concepts/#what-is-mcp).
To learn more about tools, see [here](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/tools/).
