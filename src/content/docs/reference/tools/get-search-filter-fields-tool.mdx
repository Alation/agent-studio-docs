# Get Search Filter Fields Tool

This tool can be used to find all possible fields which can be used for searching the Alation Data Catalog.
All possible filters will be searched, but only the ones which are the most semantically similar to the original search term will be returned.
The amount of results can be controlled through a parameter.

## Example usage

```json
{
  "search_term": "compliance",
  "limit": 10
}
```
