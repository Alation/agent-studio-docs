# SQL Execution Tool

This tool can be used to run queries against a data product.
Note that mutating queries (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.) are not allowed.
The data product must have a SQL compatible data source associated with it.

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "data_product_id": "my-data-product",
  "sql": "SELECT 1;",  // Query to execute.
  "result_table_name": "select_one",  // Name to describe the tabular results of the query.
  "pre_exec_sql": "",  // Optional, SQL to execute before sampling tables. Useful for setting session-level context data in a DB.
  "auth_id": "string",  // Optional
}
```
