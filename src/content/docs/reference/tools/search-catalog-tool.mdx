## Search Catalog Tool

This tool can be used to search for objects & assets within the Alation Data Catalog.
Types of objects include: tables, schemas, columns, articles, and glossary terms.
`filters` should only be used for custom fields, and should follow the same [format](https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/customize-the-aggregated-context-api-calls-with-a-signature#fields) as the aggregated context signature.

### Example usage

```json
{
  "search_term": "Agriculture",
  "object_types": [
    "table"
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "filter_id": 0,
      "filter_values": [
        "foo",
        "bar"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "limit": 20
}
```
