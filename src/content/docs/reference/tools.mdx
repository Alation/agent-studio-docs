Tools are one of the main primitives for building agentic workflows & systems.
Agents can choose to call tools as they see fit in order to learn about their environment, and to take actions to act upon this information. 
Typically, tools will be accessed through an [MCP server](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/key_concepts/#what-is-mcp).
To learn more about tools, see [here](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/tools/).

## Alation Context

:::danger
This tool is deprecated in favor of the [Catalog Context Search Agent](../agents/default/catalog-context-search), and will be removed in February 2026! 
:::

This tool fetches catalog objects from Alation's Data Catalog based on natural language input. 
Some examples of objects would include: Schema, Table, Column, Query, Glossary, Document, Article, Term, BI Folder, BI Report, and BI Field.
A signature can be used to narrow down both the initial search space, as well as the output returned.
For more information on signatures, see the [official Alation documentation](https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/customize-the-aggregated-context-api-calls-with-a-signature).

### Example usage

```json
{
  "question": "What brewery information is there in the catalog?",
  "signature": {
    "table": {
      "fields_required": [
        "name",
        "title",
        "description",
        "url"
      ],
      "fields_optional": [
        "columns"
      ],
      "child_objects": {
        "columns": {
          "fields": [
            "name",
            "title",
            "data_type",
            "description"
          ]
        }
      },
      "limit": 15
    }
  }
}
```

## BI Report Search Tool

This tool can be used to search the Alation Data Catalog for BI reports.
Results can optionally be filtered using the `filters` and `limit` parameters.
`filters` should only be used for custom fields, and should follow the same [format](https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/customize-the-aggregated-context-api-calls-with-a-signature#fields) as the aggregated context signature.


### Example usage

```json
{
  "search_term": "Find me our analysis on PEBKAC errors.",
  "filters": [
    {
      "filter_id": 0,
      "filter_values": [
        "foo",
        "bar"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "limit": 20
}
```

## Get Catalog Object Tool

This tool can be used to fetch an object's information from the Alation Data Catalog.
Supported object types are: `schema`, `table`, and `column`.

### Example usage

```json
{
  "object_type": "schema",
  "object_id": 0
}
```

## Get Data Product Spec Tool

This tool can be used to fetch a raw data product spec in JSON format.
The output is the same as what is expected by the `update_data_product` tool.

### Example usage

```jsonc
{
  "data_product_id": "my-data-product",
  "data_product_version": "v1" // Optional
}
```

## Get Data Schema Tool

This tool fetches metadata and sample column values for all tables in a given data product.
Agents can use this tool to gain a holistic understand of the data product before move on to more intensive tasks, such as running SQL queries.

### Example usage

```jsonc
{
  "data_product_id": "my-data-product",
  "pre_exec_sql": "",  // Optional, SQL to execute before sampling tables. Useful for setting session-level context data in a DB.
  "auth_id": "string",  // Optional
  "query": "string"  // Optional, used to semantically search sample data for columns.
}
```

## Get Data Sources Tool

This tool fetches all available data sources from the Alation Data Catalog.

### Example usage

```jsonc
{
  "limit": 100
}    
```

## Get Search Filter Fields Tool

This tool can be used to find all possible fields which can be used for searching the Alation Data Catalog.
All possible filters will be searched, but only the ones which are the most semantically similar to the original search term will be returned.
The amount of results can be controlled through a parameter.

### Example usage

```json
{
  "search_term": "compliance",
  "limit": 10
}
```

### See also

- [get_search_filter_values_tool](#get_search_filter_values_tool)
- [search_catalog_tool](#search_catalog_tool)

## Get Search Filter Values Tool

This tool can be used to find particular values for a given field, which can be used to filter results from searching the Alation Data Catalog.
Use the search term to help narrow down results by semantically searching.
To search for fields which can be used for filtering, use the `get_search_filter_fields` tool.

### Example usage

```json
{
  "field_id": 0,
  "search_term": "governance",
  "limit": 10
}  
```

## List Data Products Tool

This tool can be used to fetch multiple data products based on a natural language query.

### Example usage

```jsonc
{
  "search_term": "Human Resources",
  "limit": 5,
  "marketplace_id": "my-marketplace"  // Optional
}
   
```

## Search Catalog Tool

This tool can be used to search for objects & assets within the Alation Data Catalog.
Types of objects include: tables, schemas, columns, articles, and glossary terms.
`filters` should only be used for custom fields, and should follow the same [format](https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/customize-the-aggregated-context-api-calls-with-a-signature#fields) as the aggregated context signature.

### Example usage

```json
{
  "search_term": "Agriculture",
  "object_types": [
    "table"
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "filter_id": 0,
      "filter_values": [
        "foo",
        "bar"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "limit": 20
}
```

- [get_search_filter_fields_tool](#get_search_filter_fields_tool)

## SQL Execution Tool

This tool can be used to run queries against a data product.
Note that mutating queries (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.) are not allowed.
The data product must have a SQL compatible data source associated with it.

### Example Usage

```json
{
  "data_product_id": "my-data-product",
  "sql": "SELECT 1;",  // Query to execute.
  "result_table_name": "select_one",  // Name to describe the tabular results of the query.
  "pre_exec_sql": "",  // Optional, SQL to execute before sampling tables. Useful for setting session-level context data in a DB.
  "auth_id": "string",  // Optional
}
```
