import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Connect your Alation catalog to Claude (web, desktop, and mobile) using the Remote MCP server with OAuth authentication.

:::note
This guide covers **Remote MCP** setup (OAuth-based, no local installation). For local MCP server setup, see the [Local MCP Guide](https://github.com/Alation/alation-ai-agent-sdk/blob/main/guides/mcp/claude_desktop.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

- **OAuth Client credentials** from your Alation instance ([Create OAuth Client](/agent-studio-docs/guides/authentication/user_initiated_auth/))
- **Claude subscription**: Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise

## Adding the Connector

<Steps>

1. **Open Connector Settings**

   - **Pro / Max plans:** Navigate to **Settings** → **Connectors**
   - **Team / Enterprise plans:** Navigate to **Admin Settings** → **Connectors** (Owners only)
   
   > For Team/Enterprise, only Primary Owners or Owners can add connectors. Users then individually connect and enable them.

2. **Add Custom Connector**

   Click **Add custom connector** at the bottom of the page.

   ![Add custom connector dialog](../../../../assets/img/guides/mcp_client_setup/claude/claude-add-connector.png)

   Fill in the following:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | Name | `Alation` (or your preferred name) |
   | Remote MCP server URL | `https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>.alationcloud.com/ai/mcp/` |

   Expand **Advanced settings** and enter:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | OAuth Client ID | Your client ID from Alation |
   | OAuth Client Secret | Your client secret from Alation |

   Click **Add**.

</Steps>

## Connecting (Authentication)

<Steps>

1. **Click Connect**

   Back on the Connectors page, find your Alation connector showing "Disconnected" status. Click **Connect**.

2. **Sign in to Alation**

   A browser window opens and redirects you to your Alation instance. Sign in with your Alation credentials.

   ![Alation login page](../../../../assets/img/guides/mcp_client_setup/claude/claude-alation-login.png)

   After signing in, the browser redirects back to Claude and your connector shows as connected.

</Steps>

## Enabling Tools

All tools are enabled by default after connecting. This section is optional if you want to toggle the connector or disable specific tools.

### Toggle the Connector On/Off

In a chat window, click the **+** button, then **Connectors** to see available connectors. Toggle **alation** on or off as needed.

### Configure Individual Tools

To disable or block specific tools:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Connectors**
2. Find your Alation connector and click **Configure**

   ![Alation connector with Configure button](../../../../assets/img/guides/mcp_client_setup/claude/claude-connector-configure.png)

3. Set permissions for individual tools:
      - **Always allow** - Tool runs without prompting
      - **Ask for approval** - Claude asks before using the tool
      - **Block** - Disables the tool

## Example Prompts

Once connected, try queries like:
- "What tables contain sales data?"
- "Tell me about Commission Model dashboard?"
- "Can you explain Classified columns SQL query in the catalog"

## Troubleshooting

- **"Connect" button spins or page loads forever?** The OAuth flow opens in your default browser. Make sure you're logged into claude.ai in that browser with the same account as Claude Desktop.
