Resources (MCP server, REST APIs) in Alation AI Studio support two modes of OAuth 2.0 authentication: user-initiated and machine-to-machine.

## User-initiated flow
:::note[Synonymously known as]
3-legged OAuth, Authorization Code flow, Interactive flow
:::
:::tip[When to use]
Use this when the integration requires access on behalf of a specific user, reflecting their individual permissions and roles.
:::
For **interactive** use cases where an end-user is present to authorize access, Alation supports OAuth 2.0 authorization code-based user-initiated authentication. 

This approach allows users to securely grant access to their resources without sharing their credentials.

## Machine-to-machine flow
:::note[Synonymously known as]
2-legged OAuth, Client Credentials flow, Machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication, service account flow
:::
:::tip[When to use]
Use this when the integration needs to operate independently of user context, typically for automated and scheduled flows.
:::
For **non-interactive**, **programmatic integrations**, Alation supports OAuth 2.0 client_credentials-based machine-to-machine authentication using JWTs. 

This approach provides secure **server-to-server** communication without requiring end-user interaction. 

In this mode, the **ROLE** and **permissions** associated with the OAuth client app are applied to the requests made to Alation AI Studio resources.
