	<Card title="Accurate" icon="approve-check">
		Achieve >90% accuracy before production with evaluations powered by Q&A pairs, built-in testing, and custom judges.
		Grounded in the Agentic Knowledge Layer, agents deliver results that are precise, explainable, and auditable through trusted metadata.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Customizable" icon="setting">
		Start with Agent SDK to extend tools and the Agentic Knowledge Layer to  your platform of choice.
		Or build no-code: pick a model like GPT, Claude, Gemini or your own, choose out-of-the-box agents to customize—Query, Catalog Search, Dashboard, Deep Research—add tools, and deploy anywhere.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Integrated" icon="puzzle">
		Work seamlessly across your stack with vendor-neutral design.
		Connect to 100+ systems like Snowflake, Databricks, Tableau, and Power BI.
		Deploy anywhere via MCP or REST APIs without being locked into rigid ecosystems.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Enterprise Ready" icon="seti:lock">
		Scale securely with governance built in.
		Agents inherit access and lineage from the Agentic Knowledge Layer, with built-in monitoring to flag drift.
		Compliance and audit trails ensure outcomes stay trusted, consistent, and enterprise-grade at scale.

## Build fast, your way
Build governed AI agents with speed and control.
Start with the Agent Studio [SDK](https://www.alation.com/product/ai-agent-sdk/) to extend your unique [knowledge layer](https://www.alation.com/glossary/agentic-knowledge-layer/) and tools to the platform of your choice, or with out-of-the-box templates and a guided no-code flow.
Connect to 100+ data sources—including Snowflake, Databricks, Tableau, and Power BI—and deploy into apps and workflows via MCP or REST APIs.
With a vendor-neutral design and governed metadata, Agent Studio moves ideas from concept to production fast, on your terms.

## Trust in every design
Ground agents in trusted metadata from the start.
The Agentic Knowledge Layer—made up of the Data Catalog and Data Products—gives agents the business context they need to deliver precise, explainable responses.
Validate designs with built-in evaluations, Q&A sets, and custom judges to ensure production readiness.
Unlike generic AI that hallucinates or drifts, every decision is transparent and dependable.
With accuracy engineered in, you can deploy with confidence.

## Scale with control
Expand adoption without adding risk.
Governance is embedded from day one through the Agentic Knowledge Layer, where agents inherit the same access controls, policies, and permissions your organization already trusts.
Security, compliance, and lineage aren’t bolted on as an afterthought—they’re built in, ensuring secure outcomes as usage grows.
Unlike rigid platforms that lock you into narrow ecosystems, Alation scales flexibly across your stack, enabling broad adoption without slowing innovation.
