## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized way to connect LLMs to tools that give it the ability to interact with external systems.

## Core concepts

### MCP server

Service that exposes tools through standardized protocol interfaces.
A server can contain multiple tools.

### Tool

Functions that your LLM can actively call, and decides when to use them based on user requests.
Tools can write to databases, call external APIs, modify files, or trigger other logic.

### MCP client

Instantiated by host application like Claude Desktop, VS Code, Azure Copilot studio to communicate with particular MCP servers.
A Client can connect to multiple MCP servers.

## Types of MCP server

:::tip[Choosing the Right Type]
Unless you have specific security requirements or customization needs, we recommend starting with the Alation-hosted MCP server for a hassle-free experience.
:::

Alation provides two types of MCP server:

1. **Alation-hosted MCP Server (Remote)**: A fully managed MCP server hosted by Alation, isolated per tenant.
   This is the easiest way to get started with MCP.
2. **Self-Hosted MCP server (Local)**: You can also choose to host the Alation MCP server on your machine or on infrastructure.
   This option provides more control and customization but requires you to manage the server setup and maintenance.

## Getting started with Alation-hosted MCP server

:::caution[Availability]
The Alation-hosted MCP server is only available to Alation Cloud customers
:::

The MCP server is hosted and available at `https://company-name.alationcloud.com/ai/mcp`, where `company-name` is your Alation tenant name.

To connect to it, discover and use the tools, you need a MCP-compliant client like **ChatGPT Web**, **Claude Desktop**, **VS Code**, or **Azure Copilot Studio**.

Instructions on how to set these up are provided in their respective documentation.
