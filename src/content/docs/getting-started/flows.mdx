## Overview

**Agent Flows** let you chain [agents](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/agents/) and [tools](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/tools/) into automated workflows that run on demand or on a schedule.

Instead of manually running an agent, copying its output, and pasting it into another tool, you can create a flow that does this automatically. For example:
- Generate a weekly chart and email it to your team
- Run a data quality check and create a JIRA ticket if issues are found
- Summarize new data and post to Slack

<Badge text="Key Benefit" variant="success" /> Transform repetitive multi-step tasks into automated processes that run exactly when needed.

## How Flows Work

A flow is a sequence of **steps** that run one after another. Each step is either an [**agent**](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/agents/) (which can reason and make decisions) or a [**tool**](/agent-studio-docs/getting-started/tools/) (which performs a specific action).

```d2
direction: right

start: Start {
  shape: circle
}

step1: Step 1 {
  shape: rectangle
}

step2: Step 2 {
  shape: rectangle
}

step3: Step 3 {
  shape: rectangle
}

done: Done {
  shape: circle
}

start -> step1 -> step2 -> step3 -> done
```

### Data flows forward

When a step runs, it produces **outputs**. Later steps can use those outputs as **inputs**:

```d2
direction: right

start: Start {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Start\n─────────\nruntime parameters\n(e.g., chart-prompt)"
}

agent: Agent {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Agent\n─────────\ngenerates chart\noutputs: body,\nsubject, attachments"
}

tool: Email Tool {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Email Tool\n─────────\nsends email\nuses: body, subject\nfrom Agent's outputs"
}

start -> agent: "chart-prompt"
agent -> tool: "body, subject,\nattachments"
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Key rule">
A step can only use outputs from steps that came before it. You cannot reference something that hasn't run yet.
</Aside>

### Execution model

| Behavior | What it means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Sequential** | Steps run one at a time, in order |
| **Fail-fast** | If any step fails, the flow stops immediately |
| **No loops** | Each step runs exactly once |

### What you control

| You define... | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Runtime parameters** | Values you provide each time the flow runs |
| **Step inputs** | Map each input to a static value or a previous step's output |
| **Schedule** (optional) | When the flow should run automatically |

## Accessing Flows

Navigate to **Flows** in the Agent Studio sidebar.

![Agent Studio sidebar showing Flows menu with Beta tag](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/01_agent_studio_sidebar_flows_menu.png)

The Flows page shows all your existing flows with their run history, schedules, and status.

![Empty flows list with Create flow button](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/02_flows_list_empty.png)

## Creating a flow

<Steps>
1. Click **+ Create flow** to open the flow editor
2. Define runtime inputs (parameters the flow needs when it runs)
3. Add agent and tool steps
4. Connect outputs from one step to inputs of the next
5. Save and test your flow
</Steps>

### The flow editor

When you create a new flow, you start with a visual canvas showing a **Start** node.

![New flow editor with Start node and Add step button](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/03_new_flow_editor_start.png)

The Start node is where you define **runtime inputs**—parameters that can be provided each time the flow runs.

### Defining runtime inputs

Runtime inputs let you reuse the same flow with different values. For example, a reporting flow might accept a date range or a specific query.

![Start step showing Runtime inputs configuration](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/04_start_step_runtime_inputs.png)

Add parameters with a name and optional default value:

![Start step with chart-prompt parameter configured](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/05_start_step_chart_prompt_param.png)

### Adding steps

Click **+ Add step** to add an agent or tool to your flow.

![Step selector showing available agents and tools](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/06_agent_selector_chart_generation.png)

The selector shows all available agents and tools with their descriptions and required inputs. Search or browse to find what you need.

After adding a step, the canvas updates to show the connection:

![Flow canvas showing Start connected to Chart Generation agent](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/07_flow_canvas_with_agent_step.png)

### Connecting steps with variables

The power of flows comes from **connecting outputs to inputs**. When configuring a step's inputs, you can:
- Enter a **static value** (fixed text or number)
- Select a **variable** from a previous step's output

![Dropdown showing available variables from previous steps](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/08_agent_step_input_mapping_dropdown.png)

In this example, the agent's `message` input receives the `chart-prompt` parameter from the Start step.

![Agent step with inputs fully configured](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/09_agent_step_inputs_configured.png)

For a deeper dive into how variables work, see the [Variables and Context guide](/agent-studio-docs/guides/flows/variables/).

### Chaining multiple steps

You can add as many steps as needed. Each step can reference outputs from any previous step.

![Tool selector showing Send email tool](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/10_tool_selector_send_email.png)

When configuring the email tool, you can map its inputs to the agent's outputs:

![Email step showing variable dropdown with agent outputs](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/11_email_step_variable_dropdown.png)

![Email step fully configured with all inputs mapped](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/12_email_step_fully_configured.png)

### Saving your flow

Click **Save** and provide a title and description:

![Title and description dialog for the flow](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/13_flow_title_description_dialog.png)

## Running a flow

### Manual runs

To test your flow or run it on demand:

<Steps>
1. Open the flow
2. Click **Run**
3. Provide values for any runtime inputs
4. Click **Run** to start execution
</Steps>

![Run flow dialog with runtime parameter input](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/14_run_flow_dialog.png)

### Monitoring execution

The **Runs** tab shows execution progress in real-time:

![Flow run in progress showing step status](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/15_flow_run_in_progress.png)

Each step shows its status (Completed, Running, or Pending). Expand completed steps to see their outputs.

![Completed flow run with expanded output details](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/16_flow_run_completed.png)

### Viewing results

The outputs from your flow depend on what steps you've configured. In this example, the email was sent successfully:

![Email received in Gmail with chart attachment](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/17_email_received_gmail.png)

![Chart attachment preview showing data visualization](../../../assets/img/guides/flows/18_chart_attachment_preview.png)

## Scheduling flows

Flows can run automatically on a schedule—daily, weekly, or at custom intervals.

<Aside type="note">
Scheduling requires one-time authorization. See the [Scheduling Flows guide](/agent-studio-docs/guides/flows/scheduling/) for setup instructions.
</Aside>

Once authorized, you can create schedules from the **Schedule** tab:

## Summary

Agent Flows let you:
- **Chain agents and tools** into multi-step workflows
- **Pass data between steps** using variable references
- **Run manually** for testing or on-demand execution
- **Schedule automatically** for recurring tasks
